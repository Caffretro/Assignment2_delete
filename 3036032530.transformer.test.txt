The O
British O
government O
warned O
Friday O
that O
it O
would O
refer O
the O
proposed O
trans-Atlantic O
alliance O
between O
British O
Airways O

and O
American O
Airlines O
to O
Britain O

Monopolies O

Mergers O
Commission O
unless O
the O
carriers I-ORG
complied O
with O
a O
number O
of O
conditions O
. O

Trade O
and O
Industry O
Secretary O
Ian O
Lang O
added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O
airlines O
, O
final O
clearance O
would O
hinge O
on O
an I-ORG
open O
skies O
deal O
between O
Britain O
and O
the O
United O
States O
to O
liberalise O
trans-Atlantic O
air O
traffic O
, O
which O
would O
create O
greater O
competition O
on O
the O
routes O
. O

Lang O
said O
he O
supported O
conditions O
proposed O
by O
Britain O
's O
Office O
of O
Fair O
Trading O
, O
which O
was O
asked O
to O
examine O
the O
case O
last O
month O
. O

" O
I O
agree O
... O
that O
without O
suitable O
undertakings O
the O
alliance O
would O
be O
likely O
to I-ORG
lead O
to O
a O
significant O
loss O
of O
actual O
and O
potential O
passengers O
, O
on O
those O
routes O
where O
BA O
and O
AA O
currently O
compete O
and O
for O
all O
passengers O
on O
the O
trans-Atlantic I-ORG
market O
route O
between O
the O
UK I-ORG
and O
U.S. O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

His O
comments O
came O
just O
minutes O
after O
the O
latest O
set O
of O
open O

talks O
ended O
in O
London O
with O
no O

signed O
. O

Industry O
sources I-ORG
said O
there O
was O
no O
new O
date O
for O
fresh O
talks O
and O
blamed O
the O
deadlock O
on O
uncertainty O
over O
whether O
the O
British O
Airways-American O
deal O
would O
be O
cleared O
. O

The I-ORG
conditions O
for O
clearance O
of O
the I-ORG
alliance O
were O
that B-LOC
British B-ORG

American B-LOC
drop O

However O

it O

those B-ORG
imposed I-ORG
by O
other I-PER
regulatory I-PER
authorities O
on O
similar O

. I-LOC

British O
Airways O
's O
initial O
response O
was O
that B-MISC
" O
unconditional B-ORG
divestiture O
of O
slots O
is O
unprecedented O
and O
if O
done I-PER
it O
must O
be O
on O
the I-ORG
basis O
of O

value O
. O
" O

It I-ORG
added B-LOC
that O
it O
would O
be B-LOC
" O
prepared O
to I-LOC
take O
reasonable O
steps O
to O
assist O

" O

The O

also B-LOC
wants O
British O

to O
drop O

clause O
in B-LOC
its O
agreement O
with O
USAir O
that I-MISC
bars O
it O
from O

on O
trans-Atlantic O
routes O
, O
and B-LOC
said O
both O
British B-PER

American O
should O
be O
prepared O

reduce B-LOC

in O
the O
event O
that I-MISC

It O
also O
suggested O

The O

1996-12-06 B-LOC

The O
Australian O
opposition B-PER
on O
Friday O
demanded O
a O
high-powered I-PER
investigation O
into O
paedophilia I-PER
in O
the O
Australian O
diplomatic O
service O
after O
the I-ORG
federal O
court O
forced O
the O
head O
of O
the O
existing O
inquiry O
to O
stand O
aside O
. O

The B-LOC
court O
said O
inquiry O
head O
Chris O
Hunt O
might O
be O
biased O
, O
since O
he O
privately B-MISC
told O

he I-ORG

" O
Today I-PER

appointing O

Critics O

that O
if O
there O
were I-PER
many O
paedophiles O
in O
senior O

the O

then O
a O
